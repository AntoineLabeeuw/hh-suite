{\large \bf Summary}\\[2mm]

{
\noindent The HHsearch/HHblits suite is an open source software package for highly sensitive sequence searching based on the pairwise comparison of hidden Markov models (HMMs). It contains HHsearch and HHblits among other programs and utilities. HHsearch takes as input a multiple sequence alignment or profile HMM and can search a database of HMMs such as the PDB, Pfam, or InterPro for homologous proteins. HHsearch is a the heart of the automatic protein structure prediction server HHpred, which uses HHsearch to build pairwise alignments of target and template sequences for homology modeling. 

\noindent The HHblits program can build high-quality multiple sequence alignments starting from a single sequence or from a multiple sequence alignment. Compared to PSI-BLAST, HHblits is faster, up to twice as sensitive and produces more accurate alignments. It uses an iterative search strategy, adding significantly similar sequences from a previous search iteration to the evolving query HMM. Because HHblits is based on pairwise alignment of profile HMMs, it needs its own type of sequence databases that contain multiple sequence alignments the corresponding profile HMMs instead of single sequences. These databases are generated regularly by clustering UniProt and the nonredundant (nr) database from the NCBI. The HHblits databases UniProt20 and nr20 are regularly updated and can be downloaded together with HHblits. HHblits uses the HMM-HMM alignment algorithms in HHsearch, but it employs a fast prefilter to reduce the amount of database HMMs for which to perfrom the slow, full HMM-HMM comparison from tens of millions to a few thousands. 

\noindent In addition to the command line package described here, two web servers HHpred and HHblits are available at \url{http://hhpred.tuebingen.mpg.de} and \url{http://hhblits.lmb.uni-muenchen.de} that run the HHsearch and HHblits software and offer extended interactive functionality, such as options for checking  query and template alignments, histogram views of alignments, and building 3D models with MODELLER. In the latest CASP competition (2010), a fully automated version of HHpred based on HHsearch and HHblits was ranked best out of the 81 servers in template-based structure prediction, the category most relevant for biological applications, while having response times of minutes instead of days as most other servers (\url{http://predictioncenter.org/casp9/groups_analysis.cgi?type=server&tbm=on&submit=Filter})

The eight databases marked by an asterisc can be downloaded with HMMs in HHsearch 
format (*.hhm.tar files) and the \emph{multiple sequence alignments (MSAs)} in 
A3M format (*.a3m.tar files). The *.hhm.tar and *.a3m.tar files untar into thousands
of separate files, so before unnzipping and untarring, first create a directory for 
the database. Note that you can transform all A3M files to FASTA by using the 
\verb`reformat.pl` script supplied with HHsearch:
\begin{verbatim}
  > ./reformat.pl '*.a3m' .fas
\end{verbatim}

For the other five databases, you can download the HMM models in HMMer format as 
*.hmm.tar files. The *.hmm.tar files untar into a single concatenated HMMer file. 
For theses databases, unfortunately no alignments are publicly available (info to the 
contrary is wellcome.)

\subsection{Generate a MSA by an iterative HHblits search}\label{sect:start:msa_hhblits}

The best way to generate a MSA (Multiple Sequence Alignment) is to use the HHblits software 
from this package. HHblits performs an iterative HMM-HMM comparison and has a runtime comparable 
to that of PSI-BLAST. This runtime is achived by a fast profile-profile prefilter based on SSE2 
instructions, which reduces the number of comparisons in the time-consuming HMM-HMM comparison 
step.

HHblits needs the path to the two needed libraries
(\verb`context_data.lib` and \verb`cs219.lib` in the \verb`libs`-directory of this package) 
and the basename of the database (e.g. \verb`databases/uniprot20`). The following database files 
must be present:

\begin{verbatim}
  BASENAME.cs219                database for the prefiltering step
  BASENAME_hhm_db               HMM databases
  BASENAME_hhm_db.index         index table for HMM databases
\end{verbatim}

When performing more than 1 search iteration or if an MSA should be generated, you also need the 
following databases:

\begin{verbatim}
  BASENAME_a3m_db               A3M databases
  BASENAME_a3m_db.index         index table for A3M databases
\end{verbatim}

These default parameters for HHblits can be adapted in the configuration file 
\verb`.hhdefaults` in the binary directory or they have to be specified when calling of
HHblits on the command line. All default options can be overridden on the command line.

The database scan with HHblits can be started by typing:

\begin{verbatim}
  > ./hhblits -i query.seq -d databases/uniprot20
\end{verbatim}

The complete search results, including the pairwise query-template alignments, are written to 
the default output file, \verb`query.hhr`. If you are interested in the MSA, you have to add the 
\verb`-oa3m` option:

\begin{verbatim}
  > ./hhblits -i query.seq -d databases/uniprot20 -oa3m query.a3m
\end{verbatim}

A special parameter \verb`mact` (maximum accuracy threshold) can be used to choose the tradeoff between sensitivity and 
precision. With a low mact-value (e.g. \verb`-mact 0.01`) very sensitive, but not 
so precise alignments are generated, whereas a search with a high mact-value (e.g. \verb`-mact 0.9`) results in shorter but very precise alignments. The default value of mact in HHblits is $0.5$. 

If everything works, you will obtain an A3M-formatted MSA in file query.a3m. For obtaining
other formats you can use the \verb`reformat.pl` script, e.g. for reformatting the MSA to 
CLUSTAL format type:

\begin{verbatim}
  > ./reformat.pl a3m clu query.a3m query.clu
\end{verbatim}

Next, let's add secondary structure information to the alignment. This can be 
done by using the script \verb`addss.pl`. (You have to fill in a few paths at the top of the 
script.):

\begin{verbatim}
  > ./addss.pl query.a3m
\end{verbatim}

Now you can generate a hidden Markov model (HMM) from this MSA:
\begin{verbatim}
  > ./hhmake -i query.a3m
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Generate a MSA by buildali.pl}

An alternative way to build a multiple sequence alignment uses the script \verb`buildali.pl` from this package (although we recommend to use
the more sensitive method HHblits). \verb`buildali.pl` builds an A3M alignment 
with iterated PSI-BLAST. It checks after each round for each HSP (i.e. for each PSI-BLAST 
matched sequence fragment) if both its ends have a sufficiently high score per column 
(e.g. 1/6 bits/column) with the query sequence, or rather with a 'core profile' of sequences 
most similar to the query. It prunes the HSP ends that do not have sufficient similarity, 
thus largely suppressing the frequent problem of profile corruption coming from the ends of 
domains, coiled coil regions, or low complexity regions. In a representative all-against-all 
benchmark on SCOP20, \verb`buildali.pl` was able to reduce the number of high-scoring 
false-positives by a factor of approximately five, while only slightly reducing sensitivity 
for very remote homologs. \verb`buildali.pl` also automatically adds PSIPRED secondary structure 
prediction. 

To get \verb`buildali.pl` to run you have to fill in a few paths at the top of the script, 
for example to the BLAST directory, PSIPRED data and binaries directories etc. Some of 
the same paths also have to be inserted at the top of the script \verb`alignhits.pl` which 
is called by \verb`buildali.pl`. Finally, you need to have a non-redundant database like the 
nr from NCBI filtered to 90 and 70 percent (e.g. by using the program CD-HIT from 
Weizhong Lee, \url{http://cd-hit.org/}). You can call these databases nr90 and nr70, for 
example, and would set the \$dbbase variable to "some\_path/nr". The script then adds 
the "90" and "70" as needed. It will first search the nr90 until more than 50 
sequences are found, whence it will switch to the nr70. To test \verb`buildali.pl` you might 
as well set a link from the nr to nr90 and nr70, which means \verb`buildali.pl` will search 
the entire nr (which is slower and a little less sensitive). Then start \verb`buildali.pl` 
with your sequence:
\begin{verbatim}
  > ./buildali.pl query.seq
\end{verbatim}

If everything works, you will obtain an A3M-formatted MSA in file query.a3m 
as a result. (Make sure all paths are correct and your active shell is bash: 
\verb`ln -s /bin/bash /bin/sh.`)

Now you can generate a hidden Markov model (HMM) from this MSA:
\begin{verbatim}
  > ./hhmake -i query.a3m
\end{verbatim}


\subsection{Search with a profile HMM through a database}

For searching with a profile HMM as query, you can either use HHblits or HHsearch. HHblits
uses a prefilter and performs the HMM-HMM comparison only on a small subsets of HMMs that pass
this prefilter. Therefore, HHblits has a dramatical shorter runtime and a negligibly decrease of
sensitivity (see Figure \ref{fig:hhsearch_hhblits_bench}). 

\begin{figure}[t]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{hhblits-hhsearch.png}
\caption{Benchmark of HHsearch and HHblits on a SCOP20 dataset.}
\label{fig:hhsearch_hhblits_bench}
\end{figure}

The syntax of HHblits is the same whether starting with a single sequence, with an A3M-alignment
or an HMM-profile, as described in section \ref{sect:start:msa_hhblits}:

\begin{verbatim}
  > ./hhblits -i query_profile.a3m -d databases/uniprot20 -n 1
\end{verbatim}

The option \verb`-n 1` specifies to perform a single search iteration.

To try out HHsearch, untar a database, e.g.
\begin{verbatim}
  > cd scop70_1.72pre
  > tar -xzvf scop70_1.72pre.hhm.tar.gz
\end{verbatim}

The name \verb`scop70_1.72pre` stands for 'SCOP domain database version 1.72 (pre-SCOP) 
filtered to 70\% maximum sequence identity'.

Then, to generate a database file by concatenating all *.hhm files, type (under LINUX)
\begin{verbatim}
  > cat *.hhm > scop70_1.72pre.hhm
\end{verbatim}

Test whether hhsearch works by typing
\begin{verbatim}
  > ./hhsearch -i d1hxn__.hhm -d scop70_1.72pre.hhm
\end{verbatim}

You should see a dot printed for every twenty HMMs processed until at the end 
hhsearch prints out a list with the best hits from the database. The complete 
search results, including the pairwise query-template alignments, are written to the 
default output file, \verb`d1hxn__.hhr`. The format (HH results format, HHR) was 
designed to be easily parsable.

Instead of using the hmm file you can also take the a3m file for the scan. It is 
automatically converted to an HMM by HHsearch before starting the scan:
\begin{verbatim}
  > ./hhsearch -i d1hxn__.a3m -d scop70_1.72pre.hhm
\end{verbatim}



\subsection{Building customized databases}

\subsubsection{HHblits databases}

If you want to build your own database from a set of sequences, call 
\begin{verbatim}
  >   ./hhblits -i <seqfile> -o /dev/null -oa3m <MSA-file>
\end{verbatim}

for every sequence in your database, as described in subsection 3.2. Default paramters 
are up to 2 search iterations at an E-value of 1E-3. These can be changed with the 
\verb`'-n <int>'` and \verb`'-e <float>'` options (Call \verb`hhblits` without parameters for a 
complete list of options). 

The next step is to add secondary structure prediction from PSIPRED (D. Jones, 1999) to the
MSA. This can be done by the script \verb`addss.pl` (When the sequence has a SCOP or PDB identifier as first word 
in its name, the script tries to add the DSSP states as well. You need to give the 
path to your local pdb or dssp directory for this to work.):

\begin{verbatim}
  >   ./addss.pl <MSA-file>
\end{verbatim}

Now you can use the two scripts \verb`create_cs_db.pl` and \verb`create_db.pl` to generate the
databases needed for HHblits. In both scripts you have to adapt some path at the beginning.

The first script \verb`create_cs_db.pl` generates the discretized profile database needed for the 
prefilter step in HHblits (in this example named {\it DB.cs219}). You can start it by typing:

\begin{verbatim}
  > ./create_cs_db.pl -i <MSA-dir> -o databases/DB
\end{verbatim}


The other script \verb`create_db.pl` generates the HMM- and A3M-databases:

\begin{verbatim}
  > ./create_db.pl -a3mdir <MSA-dir> -oa3m databases/DB
    -ohhm databases/DB
\end{verbatim}

Note, that both databases (A3M- and HMM-database) have the same basename, the script will
automatically generate the databases DB\_a3m\_db and DB\_hhm\_db.

A list of additional options for these scripts can be retrieved by calling the scripts without 
parameters.

\subsubsection{HHsearch databases}

If you want to build your own database from a set of sequences, call 
\begin{verbatim}
  >   ./hhblits -i <seqfile> -o /dev/null -oa3m <MSA-file>
\end{verbatim}

for every sequence in your database, as described in subsection 3.2. Default paramters 
are up to 2 search iterations at an E-value of 1E-3. These can be changed with the 
\verb`'-n <int>'` and \verb`'-e <float>'` options (Call \verb`hhblits` without parameters for a 
complete list of options). 

The next step is to add secondary structure prediction from PSIPRED (D. Jones, 1999) to the
MSA. This can be done by the script \verb`addss.pl` (When the sequence has a SCOP or PDB identifier as first word 
in its name, the script tries to add the DSSP states as well. You need to give the 
path to your local pdb or dssp directory for this to work.):

\begin{verbatim}
  >   ./addss.pl <MSA-file>
\end{verbatim}

Then generate an HHM file for each MSA by typing
\begin{verbatim}
  > ls | grep "\.a3m\$" | xargs hhmake -i 
\end{verbatim}

if your MSAs have extension a3m. You can then concatenate your individual HMMs
into your database:
\begin{verbatim}
  > cat *.hhm > yourDB.hhm
\end{verbatim}
(or, if maximum buffer size is exceeded, 
\begin{verbatim}
  > ls | grep "\.hhm\$" | xargs -i cat {} >> yourDB.hhm).
\end{verbatim}

By default, the option -M first will be used. This means that exactly those columns of 
the MSAs which contain a residue in the query sequence will be assigned to Match 
/ Delete states, the others will be assigned to Insert states. (The query sequence is 
the first sequence not containing secondary structure information.) Alternatively, you 
may want to apply the 50\%-gap rule by typing \verb`-M 50`, which assigns only those columns 
to Insert states which contain more than 50\% gaps. The \verb`-M first` option makes sense 
if your alignment can best be viewed as a seed sequence plus aligned homologs to 
reinforce it with evolutionary information. This is the case in the SCOP and PDB 
versions of our HMM databases, since here MSAs are built around a single seed 
sequence (the one with known structure). On the contrary, when your alignment 
represents an entire family of homologs and no sequence in particular, it is best to 
use the 50\% gap rule. This is the case for Pfam or SMART MSAs, for instance. 
Despite its simplicity, the 50\% gap rule has been shown to perform well in practice.

When calling hhmake, you may also apply several filters, such as maximum pairwise 
sequence identity (\verb`-id <int>`), minium sequence identity with query sequence 
(\verb`-qid <int>`), or miniumum coverage with query (\verb`-cov <int>`). But beware 
of making your MSAs too restrictive, as this will lower the sensitivity for remote homologs.


\subsection{Maximum Accuracy alignment algorithm}

HHblits and HHsearch use a better alignment algorithm than the quick and 
standard Viterbi method to generate the final HMM-HMM alignments. Both realign
all displayed alignments in a second stage using the more accurate Maximum Accurracy 
(MAC) algorithm (Durbin, Eddy, Krough, Mitchison: Biological sequence analysis, page 
95; extension to HMM-HMM: Biegert, Lupas, and S\"oding (2008) \emph{Bioinformatics.} 
\textbf{24}, 807--814.). The Viterbi algorithm is employed for searching and ranking the 
matches. The realignment step is parallelized (\verb`-cpu <int>`) and typically takes a 
few seconds only.    

Please note: Using different alignment algorithms for scoring and aligning has the 
disadvantage that the pairwise alignments that are displayed are not always very similar to 
those that are used to calculate the scores! This can lead to the confusing results 
where alignments of only one or a few residues length may have probabilities of 50\% 
or more. In such cases, run the search again with the \verb`-norealign` option, which will 
skip the MAC-realignment step. This will allow you to check if the Viterbi alignments 
are valid at all, which they will probably not be. The length of the MAC alignments 
can therefore give you additional information to decide if a match is valid. In order
to avoid confusion for users of our HHpred server, the \verb`-norealign` option is the 
default there, whereas for you pros who dare to use the command line package, 
realigning is done by default.

The posterior probability threshold is controlled with the -mact [0,1[ option. 
This parameter controls the alignment algorithm's greediness. More precisely, the 
MAC algorithm finds the alignment that maximizes the sum of posterior probabilites 
minus mact for each aligned pair. Global alignments are generated with -mact 0, 
whereas -mact 0.5 will produce quite conservative local alignments. 

The -global and -local options now refer to both the Viterbi search stage as 
well as the MAC realignment stage. With -global (-local), the posterior probability 
matrix will be calculated for global (local) alignment. When -global is used in 
conjunction with -realign, the mact parameter is automatically set to 0 in order to 
produce global alignments. In other words, both following two commands will give 
global alignments:
\begin{verbatim}
  > ./hhsearch -i <query> -d <db.hhm> -realign -mact 0
  > ./hhsearch -i <query> -d <db.hhm> -realign -global
\end{verbatim}

The first version uses \emph{local} Viterbi to search and then uses MAC to realign the 
proteins globally (since mact is 0) on a \emph{local} posterior probability matrix. The 
second version uses \emph{global} Viterbi to search and then realigns globally (since mact 
is automatically set to 0) on a \emph{global} posterior matrix. To detect and align remote 
homologs, for which sometimes only parts of the sequence are conserved, the first 
version is clearly better. It is also more robust. If you expect to find globally 
alignable sequence homologs, the second option might be preferable. In that case, 
it is recommended to run both versions and compare the results. 

\subsection{How can I verify if a database match is homologous?}

Here is a list of things to check if a database match really is at least locally homologous.
 
\begin{itemize}

\item{Check probability and E-value: HHsearch can detect homologous relationships far beyond the twilight zone, i.e. below 20\% sequence identity. Sequence identity is therefore not an appropriate measure of relatedness anymore. The estimated probability of the template to be (at least partly) homologous to your query sequence is the most important criterion to decide whether a template HMM is actually homologous or just a high-scoring chance hit. When it is larger than 95\%, say, the homology is nearly certain. Roughly speaking, one should give a hit serious consideration (i.e. check the other points in this list) whenever (1) the hit has $>50\%$ probability, or (2) it has $>30\%$ probability and is among the top three hits. The E-value is an alternative measure of statistical significance. It tells you how many chance hits with a score better than this would be expected if the database contained only hits unrelated to the query. At E-values below one, matches start to get marginially significant. Contrary to the probability, when calculating the E-value HHpred does not take into account the secondary structure similarity. Therefore, the probability is a more sensitive measure than the E-value.}

\item{Check if homology is biologically suggestive or at least reasonable: Does the database hit have a function you would expect also for your query? Does it come from an organism that is likely to contain a homolog of your query protein?}

\item{Check secondary structure similarity: If the secondary structure of query and template is very different or you can't see how they could fit together in 3D, then this is a reason to distrust the hit. (Note however that if the query alignment contains only a single sequence, the secondary structure prediction is quite unreliable and confidence values are overestimated.)}

\item{Check relationship among top hits: If several of the top hits are homologous to each other, (e.g. when they are members of the same SCOP superfamily), then this will considerably reduce the chances of all of them being chance hits, especially if these related hits are themselves not very similar to each other. Searching the SCOP database is very usefull precisely for this reason, since the SCOP family identifier (e.g. a.118.8.2) allows to tell immediately if two templates are likely homologs.}

\item{Check for possible conserved motifs: Most homologous pairs of alignments will have at least one (semi-)conserved motif in common. You can identify such putative (semi-)conserved motifs by the agglomeration of three or more well-matching columns (marked with a '|' sign between the aligned HMMs) occurring within a few residues, as well as by matching consensus sequences. Some false positive hits have decent scores due to a similar amino acid composition of the template. In these cases, the alignments tend to be long and to lack conserved motifs.}

\item{Check residues and role of conserved motifs: If you can identify possible conserved motifs: are the corresponding conserved template residues involved in binding or enzymatic function?}

\item{Check query and template alignments!: A corrupted query or template alignment is the main source of high-scoring false positives. The two most common sources of corruption in an alignment are (1) non-homologous sequences, especially repetitive or low-complexity sequences in the alignment, and (2) non-homologous fragments at the ends of the aligned database sequences that are due to PSI-BLAST's greedyness. Check the query and template MSAs in an alignment viewer such as JalView or ALNEDIT.}

\item{Realign with other parameters: change the alignment parameters. Choose global instead of local mode, for instance, if you expect your query to be globally homologous to the putative homolog. Try to improve the probability by changing the values for minimum coverage or minimum sequence identity. You can also run the query HMM against other databases.}

\item{Try to use manualPSI-BLAST iterations (use FASTA in first round if you can) to try to find more distant homologs for your query alignment and jump-start HHsearch with the manually enriched alignment.}

\item{Try out other structure prediction servers!: A list of servers can be found by Battey, J.N.\ \emph{et al.} (2007) Automated server predictions in CASP7. \emph{Proteins} {\bf 69}:68-82.}

\item{Verify predictions experimentally: The ultimate confirmation of a homologous relationship or structural model is, of course, the experimental verification of some of its key predictions, such as testing the binding to certain ligands by binding assays, measuring biochemical activity, or comparing the knock-out phenotype with the one obtained when the putative functional residues are mutated.}

The summary hit list that is written to the screen shows the best hits from the 
database, ordered by the probability of being a true positive (column 4: 'Prob'). 
The meaning of the columns is the following:
\vspace{5mm}

\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}
\begin{longtable}{lp{110mm}}
Column 1 'No': & Index of hit\\

Column 2 'Hit': & First 30 characters of domain description (from nameline of query sequence)\\

Column 3 'Prob': & Probability of target to be a true positive
For the probability of being a true positive, the secondary structure score 
in column 7 is taken into account, together with the raw score in column 6 ('Score'). 
True positives are defined to be either globally homologous or they are at least 
homologous in parts, and thereby locally similar in structure. More precisely, 
the latter criterion demands that the MAXSUB score between query and hit is at 
least 0.1. In almost all cases the structural similarity will we be due to a global
OR LOCAL homology between query and target. \\

Column 4 'E-value': & 
E-value and P-value are calculated without taking the secondary structure into account!
The E-value gives the average number of false positives ('wrong hits') with a score 
better than the one for the target when scanning the datbase. It is a measure of 
reliability: E-values near to 0 signify a very reliable hit, an E-value of 10 means 
about 10 wrong hits are expected to be found in the database with a score at least 
this good.\\

Column 5 'P-value': & 
The P-value is just the E-value divided by the number of sequences in the database.
It is the probability that in a PAIRWISE comparison a wrong hit will score at least 
this good.\\

Column 6 'Score': & Raw score, does not include the secondary structure score\\

Column 7 'SS':    & Secondary structure score
This score tells how well the PSIPRED-predicted (3-state) or actual DSSP-determined 
(8-state) secondary structure sequences agree with each other. PSIPRED confidence 
values are used in the scoring, low confidences getting less statistical weight.\\

Column 8 'Cols': & The number of aligned Match columns in the HMM-HMM alignment.\\

Columns 9,10: &  Range of aligned match states from query HMM\\

Columns 11,12: & Range of aligned match states from target HMM\\
Column 14: & Number of match states in target HMM\\
\end{longtable}


\subsection{HMM-HMM pairwise alignments}

\end{verbatim}\normalsize

This is a typical example of local homology, detectable at both the sequence and the
structural level, which is embedded in globally non-homologous structures with 
different overall folds. This sequence- and structure-similar motif, called 
'helix-hairpin-helix' (HhH), makes unspecific contacts with DNA and is described 
in [Doherty, Serpell, Ponting, NAR 1996]. See [S\"oding J and Lupas AN, Bioessays 
2003] for a hypothesis relating to the pervasiveness of recurring homologous
peptide fragments.

The pairwise alignment consists of one or more blocks with the following lines:

\small\begin{verbatim}
Q ss_dssp:      the query secondary structure as determined by DSSP (when available)
Q ss_pred:      the query secondary structure as predicted by PSIPRED (when available)
Q scop-id:      the query sequence
Q Consensus:    the query alignment consensus sequence
\end{verbatim}\normalsize

The predicted secondary structure states are shown in capital letters if the PSIPRED
confidence value is between 0.7 and 1.0, for lower confidence values they are given 
in lower-case letters. With the option {\tt '-ssconf'}, {\tt 'ss\_conf'} lines can 
be added to the alignments which report the PSIPRED confidence values by numbers 
between 0 and 9 (as in versions up to 1.5).

The consensus sequence uses capital letters for well conserved columns and
lower case for partially conserved columns. Unconserved columns are marked by 
a tilde '~'. Roughly speaking, amino acids that occur with $>=60\%$ probability 
(before adding pseudocounts) are written as capital letters and amino acids that have 
$>=40\%$ probability are written as lower case letters, where gaps are included
in the fraction counts. More precisely, when the gap-corrected amino acid fraction
    \[p_i(a)*N_{eff}(i)/(N_{eff}+1)\]
is above 0.6 (0.4) an upper (lower) case letter is used for amino acid a.
Here, $p_i(a)$ is the emission probability for a in column i, $N_{eff}$ is the effective 
number of sequences in the entire multiple alignment (between 1 and 20) and $N_{eff}(i)$ is 
the effective number of sequences in the subalignment consisting of those sequences
that do not have a gap in column i. These percentages increase
approximately inversely proportionally with the fraction of gaps in the column, 
hence a column with only cysteins and 50\% gaps gets a lower case letter.
              
The line in the middle shows the column score between the query and target 
amino acid distributions. It gives a valuable indication for the alignment quality.
\small\begin{verbatim}
  = : column score below -1.5
  - : column score between -1.5 and -0.5
  . : column score between -0.5 and +0.5
  + : column score between +0.5 and +1.5
  | : column score above   +1.5
\end{verbatim}\normalsize

(A unit of column score corresponds approximately to 0.6 bits.)
From the column score line the excellent alignment around the highly conserved 
{\tt 'LPGIG'} motif in the turn between two helices is evident. The alignment around the 
first helix by contrast scores only slightly better than zero per residue and is
therefore not very reliable.

After the template block, which consists of the following lines, 
\small\begin{verbatim}
T Consensus:    the target alignment consensus sequence
T scop-id:      the target domain sequence
T ss_dssp:      the target secondary structure as determined by DSSP (when available)
T ss_pred:      the target secondary structure as predicted by PSIPRED (when available)
\end{verbatim}\normalsize

The last line in the block ({\tt Confidence}) reports the reliability of the pairwise 
query-template alignment. The confidence values are obtained from the posterior 
probabilities calculated in the Forward-Backward algorithm. A value of 8 indicates
a probability that this pair of HMM columns is correctly aligned between 0.8 and 0.8999. 
The {\tt Confidence} line is only displayed when the -realign option is acitive.


\section{File formats}

\subsection{Input alignment formats}

HMMs can be read by HHsearch/HHblits in its own .hhm format, as well as in HMMer format (.hmm).
Performance is not as good for HMMER-format as for hhm format, so please use 
our hhm format if possible. HMMER's hmm format can be converted to hhm format simply 
with hhmake:
\begin{verbatim}
  > ./hhmake -i test.hmm -o test.hhm
\end{verbatim}

This works only for a single HMM per file, not for concatenated HMMs. A safer way to 
effect the conversion is to call hhmake with the original alignment file. Note: you 
may add predicted secondary structure to the hmm file with \verb`addss.pl` before the 
conversion to hhm format.

Multiple alignments can be read in A2M, A3M, or aligned FASTA format. (Check the -M option for 
using an input format different from the default A3M). You can transform MSAs 
from Clustal or Stockholm format to A3M or aligned FASTA with the \verb`reformat.pl` utility 
supplied in this package. 

To reformat from Clustal fromat to A3M:
\begin{verbatim}
  > ./reformat.pl test.aln test.a3m
\end{verbatim}
or explicitely, if the formats can not be recognized from the extensions:
\begin{verbatim}
  > ./reformat.pl clu a3m test.clustal test.a3m
\end{verbatim}
To reformat from Stockholm to aligned FASTA:
\begin{verbatim}
  > ./reformat.pl test.sto test.fas
\end{verbatim}


\subsubsection*{Example for aligned FASTA format:}

The sequence name and its description must be contained in a single name line beginning 
with the $>$ symbol and followed directly by the sequence name. The residue data is 
contained in one or more lines of arbitrary length following the name line. No empty 
lines should be used. In aligned FASTA the gaps are written with '-' and the n'th 
letter of each sequence (except newlines) is understood to build the n'th column of the 
multiple alignment.

A2M format is derived from aligned FASTA format. It looks very similar, but it 
distinguishes between match/delete columns and insert columns. This information is 
important to uniquely specify how an alignment is transformed into an HMM. The 
match/delete columns use upper case letters for residues and the '-' symbol for 
deletions (gaps). The insert columns use lower case letters for the inserted residues. 
Gaps aligned to inserted residues are written as '.' Lines beginning with a hash \# 
symbol will be treated as commentary lines in HHsearch/HHblits (see below).

The A3M format is a condensed version of A2M format. It is obtained by omitting all '.' 
symbols from A2M format. Hence residues emitted by Match states of the HMM are in upper 
case, residues emitted by Insert states are in lower case and deletions are written '-'.
A3M-formatted alignments can be reformatted to other formats like FASTA or A2M with 
the \verb`reformat.pl` utility:
\begin{verbatim}
  ./reformat.pl test.a3m test.a2m
\end{verbatim}
Lines beginning with a hash \# symbol will be treated as commentary lines in HHsearch/HHblits
(see below). Please note that A3M, though very practical and space-efficient, 
is not a standard format, and the name A3M is our personal invention.

\subsubsection*{Secondary structure information in A3M/A2M or FASTA MSAs for HHsearch/HHblits}

The alignments read in by HHblits, HHsearch or HHmake can also contain secondary structure 
information. This information can be included in sequences with special names, 
like in this A3M file:

The sequence with name \verb`>ss_dssp` contains the 8-state DSSP-determined secondary
structure. \verb`>aa_dssp` and \verb`>aa_pred` contain the same residues as the query 
sequence (\verb`>d1a1x__` in this case). They are optional and used merely to check whether the 
secondary structure states have correctly been assigned to the alignment. \verb`>ss_pred` 
contains the 3-state secondary structure predicted by PSIPRED, and \verb`>ss_conf`
 conains the corresponding confidence values. The query sequence is the first sequence that 
does not start with a special name. It is not marked explicitely.


\subsubsection*{Name lines in alignments}

If you would like to create HMMs from alignments with a specified name which differ 
from the name of the first sequence, you can do so by adding name lines to 
your FASTA, A2M, or A3M alignment:

\scriptsize\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}\normalsize

When creating an HMM from an A3M file with hhmake, the first word of the name line is 
used as the name and file name of the HMM (PF02043 in this case). The following is an 
optional description. The descriptions will appear in the hit list and alignment section 
of the search results. The name lines can be arbitrarily long and there can be any number of 
name/description lines included, marked by a '\#' as the first character in the line. 
Note that name lines are read by HHmake but are not a part of the standard definition
of the FASTA or A2M format.
 

\subsection{HHsearch/HHblits model format (hhm-format)}

HHsearch/HHblits uses a format that is similar to HMMER format. 
This is the example of an hhm model file produced by HHmake:

The first line (\verb`HHsearch 1.5`) gives the format version, which corresponds to the HHsearch version for which this format was first introduced. Newer versions of HHsearch/HHblits may use previous format versions. The \verb`NAME` line gives the name of the HMM and an optional description. The first 30 characters of this field are used in the summary hit list of the search results in hhr format, the full name line is given above the query-template alignments of the search results. The \verb`FAM` line contains the family if the sequence is from SCOP of PFAM (used for calibration). \verb`COM` is the command that was used to generate the file. \verb`NEFF` is the diversity of the alignment, calculated as $\exp$ of the negative entropy averaged over all columns of the alignment. 

The \verb`SEQ` section contains a number of aligned, representative (pseudo) sequences in A3M format and is terminated with a line containing only a \verb`#`. The first sequence represents the DSSP secondary structure (if available, i.e. if contained in the A3M or FASTA alignment from which the HMM model was built), the second and third sequences contain the predicted secondary structure and the corresponding confidence values in the range 0--9 (if available). The fourth sequence is the consensus annotation sequence that is shown in the pairwise query-template alignments in the hhsearch output. The first \emph{real} sequence after the pseudo sequences is the \emph{seed} or \emph{master} sequence from which the alignment was built (\verb`>d1mvfd_`, in our example). If the alignment does not represent a single master sequence but an entire family, as in the case of PFAM alignments for example, the first real sequence may be a consensus sequence calculated for the entire alignment. This master sequence is shown in the pairwise query-template alignments in the hhsearch output. 

The next line specifies the null model frequencies, which are extracted from the selected substitution matrix used to add pseudocounts. Each of the positive integers is equal to 1000 times the negative logarithm of the amino acid frequency (which is between 0 and 1):
\begin{equation}
  -1000 \times \log_2( frequency)
  \label{transformation}
\end{equation}
 After the two annotation lines that specify the order of columns for the emission and transition probabilities that follow, there is a line which is not currently read by HHsearch and that lists the transition frequencies from the begin state to the first Match state, Insert state and Delete state.

The last block contains two lines for each column of the HMM. The first line starts with the amino acid in the master sequence at that column in the HMM and the column number. Following are 20  positive integers representing the match state amino acid emission frequencies (see eq.\ \ref{transformation}). Asterisks \verb`*` stand for a frequency of 0 (which would otherwise be represented by 99999). Please note that, unlike in HMMer format,  \emph{the emission frequencies do not contain pseudo-counts} in the HHsearch model format. The second line contains the seven transition frequencies (eq.\ \ref{transformation}) and three local diversities, \verb`Neff_M`, \verb`Neff_I`, and \verb`Neff_D` (see next paragraph). The end of the model is indicated by a line containing only \verb`\\`.

\subsubsection*{Calculating of the local numbers of effective sequences}

\verb`Neff_M(i)` quantifies the local diversity of the alignment at a position $i$. More precisely, it measures the diversity of subalignment $Ali_M(i)$ that contains all sequences that have a residue at column $i$ of the full alignment. The subalignment contains all columns for which at least 90\% of these sequences have no end gap. End gaps are gaps to the left of the first residue or to the right of the last residue. The latter condition ensures that the sequences in the subalignment $Ali_M(i)$ cover most of the columns in it. The number of effective sequences in the subalignment $Ali_M(i)$ is exp of the average sequence entropy over all columns of the subalignment. Hence, \verb`Neff_M` is bounded by 0 from below and 20 from above. (In practive, it is bounded by the entropy of a column with background amino acid distribution $f_a$: $N_{eff} < \sum_{a=1}^{20} f_a log f_a \approx 16$.) Similarly, \verb`Neff_I(i)` gives the diversity of the subalignment $Ali_I(i)$ of all sequences that have an insert at position $i$, and \verb`Neff_D(i)` refers to the diversity of subaligment $Ali_D(i)$ of all sequences that have a Delete (a gap) at position $i$ of the full alignment. The number of effective sequences of the full alignment, which appears as NEFF in the header of each hhm file, is the average of \verb`Neff_M(i)` over all alignment positions $i$.

\section{Summary of command-line parameters}

This is just a brief summary of command line parameters for the various binaries and
perl scripts as they are displayed by the programs when calling them without 
command line parameters. On the help pages of our HHpred/HHblits web servers

\url{http://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de} or \url{http://toolkit.lmb.uni-muenchen.de}

you can find more detailed explanations about some of the input parameters 
('Paramters' section) and about how to interpret the output ('Results' section). The FAQ 
section contains valuable practical hints on topics such as how to validate marginally
significant database matches or how to avoid high-scoring false positives.

\subsection{{\tt hhalign} -- Align a query MSA/HMM to a template MSA/HMMt}

Align a query alignment/HMM to a template alignment/HMM by HMM-HMM alignment.
If only one alignment/HMM is given it is compared to itself and the best
off-diagonal alignment plus all further non-overlapping alignments above 
significance threshold are shown. The command also allows to sample
alignments randomly, to generate png-files with dot plots showing 
alignments or to print out a list of indices of aligned residue pairs.

\subsection{{\tt addss.pl} -- add predicted secondary structure to an MSA or HMM}
Add DSSP states (if available) and PSIPRED secondary structure prediction to a multiple sequence alignment.
Input is a  multiple sequence alignment or a HMMER (multi-)model file. Allowed input formats are 
A2M/FASTA (default), A3M (-a3m), CLUSTAL (-clu), STOCKHOLM (-sto), HMMER (-hmm).
If the input file is an alignment, the output file is in A3M with default name <basename>.a3m.
If the input file is in HMMER format, the output is the same as the input, except that records 
SSPRD and SSCON are added to each model which contain predicted secondary structure and 
confidence values. In this case the output file name is obligatory and must be different from the 
input file name. (Remark: A3M looks misaligned but it is not. To reconvert to FASTA, type  
\verb`reformat.pl file.a3m file.fas`. For an explanation of the A3M format, see the HHsearch 
README file.

database (-oa3m <FILE>) and an HHM-database (-ohhm <FILE>).
If you already have HHM-models for your A3M-files, you can use them 
as additional input (-hhmdir <DIR>).
If you don't need the A3M-database, you can also start this script
with an directory of HHM-files (-hhmdir <DIR>) and as output only
the HHM-database (-ohhm <FILE>).

\section{Changes from previous versions}

(For a full history, see accompanying file CHANGES.)

\subsection{2.0.0 (June 2011)}

\begin{itemize}

\item{Include iterative HMM-HMM comparison method HHblits.
}

\item{Increase speed by using SSE3 instructions in some functions.
}

\item{Adding new option "-atab" for writing alignment as a table (with posteriors) to file.
}

\item{HHsearch is now able to read HMMER3 profiles (but should not be used due to a loss of sensitivity).
}

\end{itemize}


\subsection{1.6.0 (2010)}

\begin{itemize}
 
\item{A new procedure for estimation of P- and E-values has been implemented that
  circumvents the need to calibrate HMMs. Calibration can still be done if 
  desired. By default, however, HHsearch now estimates the lamda and mu 
  parameters of the extreme value distribution (EVD) for each pair of query 
  and database HMMs from the lengths of both HMMs and the diversities of their 
  underlying alignments. Apart from saving the time for calibration, this 
  procedure is more reliable and noise-resistant. This change only applies to 
  the default local search mode. For global searches, nothing has changed. Note
  that E-values in global search mode are unreliable and that sensitivity is 
  reduced. \\
  Old calibrations can still be used:\\
   -calm 0 : use empirical query HMM calibration (old default)\\
   -calm 1 : use empirical db HMM calibration\\
   -calm 2 : use both query and db HMM calibration\\
   -calm 3 : use neural network calibration (new default)
}

\item{Previous versions of HHsearch sometimes showed non-homologous hits with high 
  probabilities by matching long stretches of secondary structure states, 
  in particular long helices, in the absence of any similarity in the amino 
  acid profiles. Capping the SS score by a linear function of the profile score
  now effectively suppresses these spurious high-scoring false positives. 
}

\item{The output format for the query-template alignments has slightly changed.
  A 'Confidence' line at the bottom of each alignment block now reports the 
  posterior probabilities for each alignment column when the -realign option
  is active (which it is by default). These probabilities are calculated in the 
  Forward-Backward algorithm that is needed as input for the Maximium ACcuracy 
  alignment algorithm. Also, the lines 'ss\_conf' with the confidence values 
  for the secondary structure prediction are omitted by default. (They can  
  be displayed with option '-showssconf'). To compensate, secondary structure 
  predictions with confidence values between 7 and 9 are given in capital 
  letters, while for the predictions with values between 0 and 6 lower-case 
  letters are used. 
}

\item{In the hhsearch output file in the header lines before each query-database 
  alignment, the substitution matrix score (without gap penalties) of the query 
  with the database sequence is now reported in bits per column. Also, the sum
  of probabilities for each pair of aligned residues from the MAC algorithm 
  is reported here (0 if no MAC alignment is performed).
}

\item{The buildali.pl script now uses context-specific iterative BLAST (CSI-BLAST) 
  instead of PSI-BLAST. This considerably increases the sensitivity of 
  buildali.pl/HHsearch. 
}

\item{Removed a bug which produced a segfault for input alignments with more than
  15000 match columns. Now, the HHsearch binaries will issue a warning and 
  will transform only the first 15000 match columns into an HMM.
}

\item{Removed a bug in the multi-threading code that could lead to occasional 
  hang-ups (race condition) in situations where slow file access was impeding 
  program execution and inter-thread signaling was unreliable.
}

\item{Removed a memory leak and optimized memory management.
}

\item{Removed a bug in hhalign that could lead to unreasonably significant E-values 
  and probabilities due to calibration problems.
}

\item{HHsearch now performs realign with MAC-alignment only around Viterbi-hit.
}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{1.5.0 (August 2007)}

\begin{itemize}

\item{By default, HHsearch realigns all displayed alignments in a second stage 
  using the more accurate Maximum Accuracy (MAC) alignment algorithm 
  (Durbin, Eddy, Krough, Mitchison: Biological sequence analysis, page 95;
  HMM-HMM version: J. S\"oding, unpublished). As before, the Viterbi algorithm 
  is employed for searching and ranking the matches. The realignment step is 
  parallelized (\verb`-cpu <int>`) and typically takes a few seconds only. You can 
  switch off the MAC realignment with the -norealign option. 
     The posterior probability threshold is controlled with the -mact [0,1[ 
  option. This parameter controls the alignment algorithm's greediness. More 
  precisely, the MAC algorithm finds the alignment that maximizes the sum of 
  posterior probabilites minus mact for each aligned pair. Global alignments 
  are generated with -mact 0, whereas -mact 0.5 will produce quite conservative
  local alignments. Default value is -mact 0.35, which produces alignments of
  roughly the same length as the Viterbi algorithm. 
     The -global and -local (default) option now refer to both the Viterbi search 
  stage as well as the MAC realignment stage. With -global (-local), the 
  posterior probability matrix will be calculated for global (local) 
  alignment. Note that '-local -mact 0' will produce global alignments from
  a local posterior probability matrix (which is not at all unreasonable).
}
\item{An amino acid compositional bias correction is now performed by default.
  This increases the sensitivity by 25\% at 0.01 errors per query and by 5\% at 
  0.1 errors per query. By recalibrating the Probabilities, the increased 
  selectivity of this new version allows to give higher probabilities for the 
  same P-values. Also, the score offset could be increased from -0.1 bits to 0 
  as a consequence. 
}

\item{The algorithm that filters the set of the most diverse sequences (option 
  -diff) has been improved. Before, it determined the set of the N most 
  diverse sequences. In the case of multi-domain alignments, this could lead 
  to severely underrepresented regions. E.g. when the first domain is only 
  covered by a few fairly similar sequences and the second by hundreds of very 
  diverse ones, most or all of the similar ones were removed. The '-diff N' 
  option now filters the most diverse set of sequences, keeping at least N 
  sequences in each block of >50 columns. This generally leads to a total 
  number of sequences that is larger than N. Speed is similar. The default
  is '-diff 100' for hhmake and hhsearch. Speed is similar. Use -diff 0 to 
  switch this filter off.
}
\item{The sensitivity for the -global alignment option has been significantly 
  increased by a more robust statistical treatment. The sensitivity in -global
  mode is now only 0-10\% lower than for the default -local option on a SCOP
  benchmark, i.e. when the query or the templates represent single structural 
  domains. The E-values are now more realistic, although still not as 
  reliable as for -local. The Probabilities were recalibrated.
}
\item{A new binary hhalign has been added. It is similar to hhsearch, but performs
  only pairwise comparisons. It can produce dot plots, tables of aligned 
  residues, and it can sample alternative alignments stochastically. It uses 
  the MAC algorithm by default. 
}
\item{HHsearch and hhalign can generate query-template multiple alignments in 
  FASTA, A2M, or A3M format with the -ofas, -oa2m, -oa3m options 
}
\item{Returned error values were changed to comply with convention that 0 means no errors:
\begin{enumerate}
   \item{Finished successfully}
   \item{Format error in input files}
   \item{File access error}
   \item{Out of memory }
   \item{Syntax error on command line}
   \item{Internal logic error (please report)}
   \item{Internal numeric error (please report)}
   \item{Other}
\end{enumerate}
}	

\item{Added script \verb`buildali.pl <file>` to automatically build PSI-BLAST mutliple 
  sequence alignments, including predicted and DSSP secondary structure. 
  \verb`buildali.pl` is much more robust to alignment corruption by non-homologous fragment by
  pruning sequences individually from both ends as necessary (J. S\"oding, unpublished).
}
\item{Added script \verb`hhmakemodel.pl <file.hhr>` that parses hhsearch results files 
  and can generate FASTA or PIR multiple alignments or build rough 3D models.
}
\item{Moved memory allocation from stack to heap to avoid segmentation faults
  under some Windows systems.
}
\item{Removed a bug due to which pseudocounts where added to HMMer HMMs (which 
  already have their own pseudocounts added). This bug reduced sensitivity 
  for HMMs read in HMMer format.
}
\item{Removed a bug due to which the query-template alignments where not displayed
  on some platforms when output was directed to stdout
}
\item{Removed a bug that caused occasional segfaults under SunOS when reading HMMer files
}
\item{Added multi-threading (\verb`-cpu <int>`) for Windows x86 platform
}
\item{Cleaned up output formatting of summary list for Windows x86
}
\item{Stopped support for the Alpha/DEC platform
}
\end{itemize}

Is anyone still interested in Mac OSX/PPC or SunOS support?
