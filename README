* About

This README only serves as a quick start guide.
For full documentation see the user guide.

* Installation

** Compilation

$ make

Compilation produces by default static binaries. If you encounter
missing library errors, also make sure you have the static versions
installed, e.g. glibc-static.


** Installation

Either install in current directory:

$ make install

Or set INSTALL_DIR to the base directory (absolute path), e.g. /usr/local,
where you want to install:

$ make install INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local


** Download Databases

Download current databases from our FTP-server:
ftp://toolkit.lmb.uni-muenchen.de/HHblits/
These are then usually specified on the command line (e.g. -d ...).

If you also want to make use of the scripts, e.g. addss.pl, edit HHPaths.pm in
$INSTALL_DIR/lib/hh/scripts/HHPaths.pm


** Setup Environment (HHLIB)

In your shell set HHLIB to $INSTALL_DIR/lib/hh, e.g (for bash, zsh, ksh):

$ export HHLIB=/usr/local/lib/hh

Otherwise the programms will not find the cs and context libraries,
which then have to be specified on the command line.


* Usage

** Databases

HHblits needs an HMM-database containing of HHM- or HMMER-files for all database proteins (e.g. uniprot20_hhm_db) 
and a special cs-database-file for the fast prefilter (e.g. uniprot20.cs219). When performing more than 1 iteration 
of HHblits or when an alignment should be generated (i.e. -oa3m option), HHblits needs also an A3M-database 
containing A3M-alignments for each profile HMM (e.g. uniprot20_a3m_db).
Databases can be downloaded from our FTP-server (ftp://toolkit.lmb.uni-muenchen.de/HHblits/databases/).

** Running

For performing a single search iteration of HHblits (corresponding to an HHsearch run with prefiltering), run HHblits 
with the following command:

$ hhblits -i <input-file> -o <result-file> -n 1 -d <database-basename>

For generating an alignment of homologous sequences, we recommend the following options:

$ hhblits -i <input-file> -o <result-file> -oa3m <result-alignment> -d <database-basename>

You can get a detailed list of options for HHblits by running HHblits with the "-h" option.

Example (if HHLIB is set):

$ hhblits -d uniprot20_02Sep11 -i ephrines_hhb4.fas
