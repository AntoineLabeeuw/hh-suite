* About

This README only serves as a quick start guide.
For full documentation see the user guide.

* Installation

Compile:

$ make

Either install in current directory:

$ make install

Or set INSTALL_DIR to the base directory, e.g. /usr/local, where you want to install:

$ make install INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local

Download current databases from our FTP-server:
ftp://toolkit.lmb.uni-muenchen.de/HHblits/
These are then usually specified on the command line (e.g. -d ...).

If you also want to make use of the scripts, e.g. addss.pl, edit HHPaths.pm in
$INSTALL_DIR/lib/hh/scripts/HHPaths.pm


* Usage

** Databases

HHblits needs an HMM-database containing of HHM- or HMMER-files for all database proteins (e.g. uniprot20_hhm_db) 
and a special cs-database-file for the fast prefilter (e.g. uniprot20.cs219). When performing more than 1 iteration 
of HHblits or when an alignment should be generated (i.e. -oa3m option), HHblits needs also an A3M-database 
containing A3M-alignments for each profile HMM (e.g. uniprot20_a3m_db).
Databases can be downloaded from our FTP-server (ftp://toolkit.lmb.uni-muenchen.de/HHblits/databases/).

** Running

For performing a single search iteration of HHblits (corresponding to an HHsearch run with prefiltering), run HHblits 
with the following command:

$ hhblits -i <input-file> -o <result-file> -n 1 -d <database-basename>

For generating an alignment of homologous sequences, we recommend the following options:

$ hhblits -i <input-file> -o <result-file> -oa3m <result-alignment> -d <database-basename>

You can get a detailed list of options for HHblits by running HHblits with the "-h" option.
